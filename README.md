Hello,

Thank you for visiting my original portfolio page. 

I like the idea of a "sticky" header - one that follows you even though you scroll down. This makes it easy to navigate. However, I don't see this is very common around the web. 

Using the sticky header conflicted with my first attempt at a "smooth" scroll with JavaScript (app.js). The smooth scroll algorithm is dependent upon the location of the link in relation to the top of the page. If the user has scrolled to a different part of the page, and then uses the header, the smooth scroll does not quite work. 

That's why I had to use a different scroll algorithm, which is not quite "smooth" (app2.js).
